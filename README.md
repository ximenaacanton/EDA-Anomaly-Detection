# Anomaly Detection in Industrial Machine Data

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting anomalies in sensor readings from an industrial machine used by a leading pharmaceutical company in Mexico. The goal is to identify recurring patterns in the data that may be linked to machine failures, data entry errors, or operational inefficiencies, providing actionable insights for predictive maintenance strategies.

## Project Steps

### 1. **Data Processing**
   - Processed over 90 million sensor readings from industrial machinery.
   - Handled missing values, filtered out irrelevant data, and structured 8 key variables for analysis, including temperature, pressure, and rejection rates.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Performed a comprehensive EDA on the cleaned dataset.
   - Analyzed the distribution of key variables and identified temporal trends affecting the data.
   - Applied descriptive statistics to understand data behavior and detected anomalies.

### 3. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Applied Z-Score methodology to identify recurring anomalies.
   - Linked anomalies to machine failures, data entry errors, and operational inefficiencies.
   - Generated insights that can guide predictive maintenance strategies.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for data visualization
- **NumPy** for numerical operations

## Key Insights
- Anomaly detection helped identify trends that would otherwise be overlooked, providing actionable insights for improving machine reliability and reducing downtime.
- The analysis revealed operational inefficiencies and suggested areas for preventive measures.

## Next Steps
- Build predictive models based on detected anomalies to predict future machine failures and maintenance needs.
- Implement more advanced machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection to improve prediction accuracy.
